This is an attempt in experimenting with different machine learning methods.

On first glance using support vector machines would be the best choice, but I'll try decision trees as well.

After optimizing, I'll attempt the ensemble method.

Lastly, I'll try tensorflow and keras to see which ultimately is the best.
